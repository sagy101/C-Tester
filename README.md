This project automates the batch grading of multiple C programs. It sets up the Visual Studio C++ build environment, compiles and executes student C source files against a known-correct solution, compares outputs, and produces grading reports. Additionally, it generates Excel files with detailed grade breakdowns for each question folder as well as a consolidated final grade file for easy uploading (e.g. Moodle). 

---

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Preprocessing:** Extracts student submissions from nested zip files, organizes C files (`*_qN.c`) into question folders (`QN/C/`), and renames them based on student ID. Reports processing issues.
*   **Automated Grading:**
    *   Sets up the Visual Studio C++ build environment (`vcvars64.bat`).
    *   Compiles student C code and a provided `original_sol.c` using `cl.exe`.
    *   Runs compiled student code against inputs from `input.txt`.
    *   Compares student output against the ground truth generated from `original_sol.c`.
    *   Handles timeouts and compilation errors.
*   **Excel Reporting:**
    *   Generates detailed Excel reports per question (`QN_grades_to_upload.xlsx`).
    *   Creates a consolidated `final_grades.xlsx` with weighted averages.
    *   Applies penalties based on preprocessing errors (`submit_error.txt`).
    *   Optional "slim" mode for final grades only.
*   **Dual Interface:**
    *   Modern GUI (`gui.py`) for interactive use with progress display and cancellation.
    *   Robust CLI (`main.py`) for scripting and automation.
*   **Flexible Configuration:** Define questions, weights, and penalties in `configuration.py` or override via the GUI.
*   **Cleanup Utilities:** Easily clear generated files (grades, output, C copies, build files, excels) via GUI or CLI.

## üì• Input Data Structure

### Preprocessing Input Zip File

For the **Preprocessing** step (via GUI or CLI) to work correctly, the input zip file you provide must adhere to the following structure:

<details>
  <summary>View Expected Input Zip Structure</summary>
  
  1.  The main zip file should contain **individual zip files** for each student submission.
  2.  Each inner zip file's name **must end with the student's ID number**, preceded by an underscore (e.g., `Student Name_Assign1_123456789.zip`). The part before the underscore and ID is not used by default but helps organization.
  3.  When an inner zip (e.g., `Student Name_Assign1_123456789.zip`) is extracted, it creates a folder (`Student Name_Assign1_123456789/`).
  4.  Inside this folder, the script looks for C files named in the format `some_filename_qN.c`, where `N` is the question number (e.g., `main_program_q1.c`, `my_solution_q2.c`).
  5.  **Alternatively**, if no matching C files are found directly inside the student's folder, the script will look for them inside **exactly one subdirectory** within the student's folder (e.g., `Student Name_Assign1_123456789/Submission/main_program_q1.c`). It will not search deeper than one subfolder level.
      
  **Example:**
  ```
  main_submissions.zip          <-- Input zip file
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FirstName_LastName_Assign1_123456789.zip
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ # Extracted to folder FirstName_LastName_Assign1_123456789/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main_code_q1.c
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ helper_functions_q2.c
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Another_Student_Assign1_987654321.zip
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ # Extracted to folder Another_Student_Assign1_987654321/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SubmittedFiles/          <-- Single subfolder is OK
  ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ program_q1.c
  ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ library_q2.c
  ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ readme.txt
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Problem_Student_Assign1_111223344.zip
      ‚îÇ # Extracted to folder Problem_Student_Assign1_111223344/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ source.c                <-- File doesn't match _qN.c pattern, will cause error in submit_error.txt
  ```
  
  Submissions that don't follow this structure (e.g., missing ID in zip name, C files not matching `_qN.c` pattern, C files nested too deep, no C files found) **will not be processed correctly** and will be reported with errors in `submit_error.txt`.
</details>

### Question Folders (`Q*`)

For the **Grading** step, each question folder (e.g., `Q1`, `Q2`) defined in the configuration must exist and contain:

*   `input.txt`: File containing test case inputs (one per line).
*   `original_sol.c`: File with the correct solution code for generating ground truth output.

## üöÄ Usage

Choose the interface that suits your needs:

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Recommended for interactive use.

1.  **Run** the GUI script (ensure dependencies are installed and environment is activated):
    ```bash
    python gui.py
    ```
2.  **Configure:**
    *   The "Configuration" section displays the current questions and weights in a table.
    *   Modify folder names and weights directly in the table.
    *   Use "Add Question" to add a new empty row or "Remove Last" to delete the bottom row.
    *   Edit the "Submission Error Penalty" value in its field.
    *   **Important:** After making any changes, click **"Apply Config"**. This will parse and validate your inputs.
        *   The **Status** label below the buttons will indicate if the current configuration is "Valid", "INVALID" (with details in a popup), or if there are "Unapplied changes".
        *   The "Apply Config" button will be highlighted if changes are unapplied.
        *   The "Run Preprocess" and "Run Grading" buttons are **disabled** if the configuration is invalid or has unapplied changes.
3.  **Use the Actions:**
    *   **Preprocessing:** Click "Browse" to select the main submissions zip file (containing individual student zips), then click "Run Preprocess" (requires valid applied config).
    *   **Grading:** Click "Run Grading" to start the compilation, execution, and report generation using the *currently applied GUI configuration*. The tool will re-validate the folder structure (`C/`, `input.txt`, `original_sol.c`) for the configured questions just before starting; if issues are found, it will show an error and stop.
    *   **Clear Actions:** Click the desired button. Actions related to specific questions (Clear Grades, Output, C Files, All) use the *currently applied GUI question list*.
    *   **Output:** Logs, progress descriptions, and the progress bar appear at the bottom. Long tasks can be cancelled.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

Suitable for scripting or users preferring the command line. Uses the static configuration set in `configuration.py`.

1.  **Configure:** Edit `configuration.py` to define `questions`, `folder_weights`, and `penalty`.
2.  **Run** `main.py` with commands:

<details>
  <summary>View CLI Commands</summary>
  
  *   **Preprocess submissions:**
      ```bash
      python main.py preprocess --zip-path <path_to_your_zip_file.zip>
      ```
      Extracts nested zips, organizes C files into `QN/C/`, renames them to `ID.c`, and generates `submit_error.txt`. Requires the input zip file to follow the structure detailed in the "Input Data Structure" section.
      
  *   **Run grading:**
      ```bash
      python main.py run
      ```
      Compiles, executes, compares outputs, and generates grade files and Excel reports based on `configuration.py`.

  *   **Clear generated files:**
      ```bash
      # Clear specific items: grades, output, c, excels, build
      python main.py clear <item_to_clear> 
      # Example: Clear build files (.exe, .obj)
      python main.py clear build 
      
      # Clear grades, output, excels, and build files:
      python main.py clear all 
      ```
      *(Note: `clear all` does not clear the `C/` folders)*

  *   **View help:**
      ```bash
      python main.py --help
      ```

## üìñ How It Works (Briefly)

1.  **Preprocessing (`preprocess` command / GUI button):**
    *   Extracts main zip -> extracts inner student zips.
    *   Identifies student ID from folder name (`..._ID`).
    *   Finds `*_qN.c` files (directly or in one subfolder).
    *   Copies files to `QN/C/ID.c`.
    *   Logs errors to `submit_error.txt`.
2.  **Grading (`run` command / GUI button):**
    *   Sets up MSVC environment.
    *   For each question folder in config:
        *   Reads `input.txt`.
        *   Compiles and runs `original_sol.c` to get ground truth outputs.
        *   Compiles student `ID.c` files in parallel.
        *   Runs compiled student code against inputs in parallel.
        *   Compares student output to ground truth.
        *   Writes individual grade/output files to `grade/` and `output/`.
    *   Cleans up `.obj` files.
3.  **Excel Generation (Part of `run`):**
    *   Reads grade files for each question.
    *   Generates `QN_grades_to_upload.xlsx`.
    *   Merges data, calculates weighted final grades.
    *   Parses `submit_error.txt` and applies `penalty` from config.
    *   Generates `final_grades.xlsx` (full or slim format).

## üêõ Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>View Troubleshooting Tips</summary>

*   **Missing `cl.exe` or Build Tools:**
    Verify that Visual Studio with C++ build tools is installed and the path to `vcvars64.bat` in `Process.py` is correct. Ensure you are running the script in a terminal where the VS environment can be activated (e.g., Developer Command Prompt or a standard terminal after `vcvars64.bat` has been sourced).

*   **Missing or Incorrect `input.txt` / `original_sol.c`:**
    Ensure each configured question folder (`Q1/`, etc.) contains these required files.

*   **Compilation Failures:**
    Check the `.txt` files in the `grade/` subfolders for detailed `cl.exe` error messages.

*   **Configuration Errors (CLI Startup / GUI Apply):**
    The tool validates `configuration.py` (for CLI) or the GUI inputs. Ensure:
    *   All folders listed in `questions` exist in the project root.
    *   `folder_weights` keys exactly match the `questions` list.
    *   Weight percentages sum *exactly* to 100.
    *   Penalty (GUI) is a non-negative integer.

*   **GUI / Tkinter Issues:**
    *   **Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'`:** Your base Python installation is missing Tcl/Tk support.
        *   **Solution:** Run your Python installer again, choose "Modify", ensure "tcl/tk and IDLE" is checked. Then, **recreate your virtual environment** (`.venv`) by deleting the old folder, creating a new one (`python -m venv .venv`), activating it, and reinstalling dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`). Test with `python -m tkinter`.
    *   **Network Errors during `pip install`:** Check firewalls, proxies, or antivirus settings that might block connections to PyPI (pypi.org).
